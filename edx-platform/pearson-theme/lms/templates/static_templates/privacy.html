          </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p><em>Pearson</em>  also acts as, among other things, venues for employers to post job opportunities and search for and evaluate job candidates and candidates to post CVs and Profiles and search for and evaluate job opportunities.</p>
        <p><em>Pearson</em>  does not screen or censor the listings, including Profiles offered.  <em>Pearson</em>  is not involved in the actual transaction between employers and candidates. As a result,  <em>Pearson</em>  is not responsible for User Content, the quality, safety or legality of the jobs or CVs posted, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of employers to offer job opportunities to candidates or the ability of candidates to fill job openings and  <em>Pearson</em>  makes no representations about any jobs, CVs or User Content on  <em>Pearson</em>  </p>
        <p>While  <em>Pearson</em>  reserves the right in its sole discretion to remove User Content, job postings, CVs or other material from  <em>Pearson</em>  from time to time,  <em>Pearson</em>  does not assume any obligation to do so and to the fullest extent permitted by law, disclaims any liability for failing to take any such action.</p>
        <p>Note that there are risks, including but not limited to the risk of physical harm, of dealing with strangers, underage persons or people acting under false pretenses. You assume all risks associated with dealing with other users with whom you come in contact through  <em>Pearson</em>  </p>
        <p>By its very nature other people's information may be offensive, harmful or inaccurate, and in some cases will be mislabeled or deceptively labeled. We expect that You will use caution and common sense when using the  <em>Pearson</em></p>
        <p>Because learner authentication on the Internet is difficult,  <em>Pearson</em>  cannot and does not confirm that each User is who they claim to be.</p>
        <p>Because we do not and cannot be involved in learner to learner dealings or control the behavior of participants on  <em>Pearson</em>,  in the event that You have a dispute with one or more learners, you release  <em>Pearson</em>  (and our agents and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential and direct and indirect) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
        <p>The  <em>Pearson</em>  Sites and the  <em>Pearson</em>  Content may contain inaccuracies or typographical errors.  <em>Pearson</em>  makes no representations about the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of any  <em>Pearson</em>  Site or the  <em>Pearson</em>  Content. </p>
        <p><em>Pearson</em>  encourages You to keep a back-up copy of any of Your User Content. To the extent permitted by law, in no event shall  <em>Pearson</em>  be liable for the deletion, loss, or unauthorized modification of any learner content.</p>
        <p><em>Pearson</em>  does not provide or make any representation as to the quality or nature of any of the third party products or services purchased through any  <em>Pearson</em>  Site, or any other representation, warranty or guaranty. Any such undertaking, representation, warranty or guaranty would be furnished solely by the provider of such third party products or services, under the terms agreed to by the provider.</p>
        <p>In addition, we may share aggregated information that does not personally identify you with the public and with third parties, including but not limited to researchers and business partners.</p>
        <h2>6. Use For Personalization And Pedagogical Improvements</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to provide current and future visitors with the best possible educational experience. To further this goal, we sometimes present different users with different versions of course materials and software. We do this to personalize the experience to the individual learner (assess the learner's level of ability and learning style, and present materials best suited to the learner), to evaluate the effectiveness of our course materials, to improve our understanding of the learning process and to otherwise improve the effectiveness of our offerings. We may publish or otherwise publicize results from this process, but, unless otherwise permitted under this Policy, those publications or public disclosures will not include Personal Information.</p>
        <h2>7. Links To Other Websites</h2>
        <p>The Site contains links to websites published by third parties, including other content providers as well as certain service providers, such as those who process payments on behalf of  <em>Pearson</em>.  These other websites are not under our control, and you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the collection and use of your information by such websites, unless we have otherwise indicated in this Policy. We encourage you to be aware when you are be redirected to a third party website and review the privacy policies of each website you visit and use.</p>
        <h2>8. Security</h2>
        <p><em>Pearson</em>  has a program designed to protect Personal Information in its possession or control. This is done through a variety of privacy and security policies, processes and procedures, including administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Personal Information that it creates, receives, maintains, or transmits. Nonetheless, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure; and therefore,  <em>Pearson</em>  cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        <h2>9. Changing Our Policy</h2>
        <p>Please note that we review and may make changes to this Policy from time to time. When changes are made, the Policy link will include a notation 'Revised (date).' indicating that you should review the new terms, which will be effective immediately upon posting on this page, with an updated effective date. The notation will be included in the Policy link for at least seven (7) days after the update has been made. By accessing the Site after any changes have been made, you signify your agreement on a prospective basis to the modified Policy and any changes contained therein. In case you miss the notification referenced above, be sure to return to this page periodically to ensure familiarity with the most current version of this Policy.</p>
        <h2>10. Minors</h2>
        <p>Our Site is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 15, and  <em>Pearson</em>  does not knowingly collect personal data from those in this age group. If we become aware that someone under the age of 15 has registered, we will expunge any related Personal Information from our records.</p>
